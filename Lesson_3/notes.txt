-An algorithm is a sequence of instructions to perform a computation
-complexity of algorithms
Example sequential vs binary search in a ordered list:
-- sequential:  best case:      1
                worst case:     N
                average case:   N/2
-- binary: start from the middle and consider the fact that the list is ordered, then bisect again
                best case:      1
                worst case:     log_2 N
                average case:   O(log_2 N)
Convention: if a variable has the same name of a built in function, add an underscore at the end
